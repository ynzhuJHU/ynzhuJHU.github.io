<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Biomedical Engineering at Johns Hopkins University, advised by Dr. [Hai-Quan Mao](https://maogroup.jhu.edu/). I received my B.S. in Pharmacy from Sichuan University in 2019 and my M.S. in Biomedical Engineering from Johns Hopkins in 2021. My doctoral research focuses on the design and optimization of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) with tailored compositions for gene therapy and mRNA vaccine delivery. Through this work, I aim to advance next-generation nanomedicine platforms that can improve therapeutic efficacy and immunogenic precision.

      Hydrogel materials have emerged as versatile platforms for biomedical applications. Here this group reports an mRNA lipid nanoparticle-incorporated microgel matrix for immune cell recruitment, antigen expression and presentation, and cellular interaction, thereby eliciting antitumor efficacy with a single dose.

[Optimization of lipid nanoparticles for gene editing of the liver via intraduodenal delivery](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0142961224000930)

- Lipid nanoparticles (LNP) have recently emerged as successful gene delivery platforms for a diverse array of disease treatments. Here, we employed a multi-step screening method to optimize the type of helper lipid and component ratios in a plasmid DNA (pDNA) LNP library to efficiently deliver pDNA through intraduodenal delivery as an indicative route for oral administration. Beyond reporter protein expression, we assessed the efficiency in non-viral gene editing in mouse liver mediated by LNPs to knockdown PCSK9 and ANGPTL3 expression, thereby lowering low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels.

- Gene therapies and cellular programming rely on effective cell transfection. Here it is shown that optimizing the viscosity of cell culture media to match that of biological fluids substantially enhances the transfection efficiency for various gene delivery vehicles across different cell types.

- Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) can be designed to potentiate cancer immunotherapy by promoting their uptake by antigen-presenting cells, stimulating the maturation of these cells and modulating the activity of adjuvants. In this paper, we report an LNP-screening method for the optimization of the type of helper lipid and of lipid-component ratios to enhance the delivery of tumour-antigen-encoding mRNA to dendritic cells and their immune-activation profile towards enhanced antitumour activity.

- Lipid nanoparticles hold great potential as an effective non-viral vector for nucleic acid-based gene therapy. Plasmid DNA delivery can result in extended transgene expression compared to mRNA-based technologies, yet there is a lack of systematic investigation into lipid nanoparticle compositions for plasmid DNA delivery. In this paper, we report a multi-step screening platform to identify optimized plasmid DNA lipid nanoparticles for liver-targeted transgene expression.

[Size-controlled and shelf-stable DNA particles for production of lentiviral vectors](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8283758/)

- Polyelectrolyte complex particles assembled from plasmid DNA (pDNA) and poly(ethylenimine) (PEI) have been widely used to produce lentiviral vectors (LVVs) for gene therapy. The current batch-mode preparation for pDNA/PEI particles presents limited reproducibility in large-scale LVV manufacturing processes, leading to challenges in tightly controlling particle stability, transfection outcomes, and LVV production yield. In this paper, we identified the size of pDNA/PEI particles as a key determinant for a high transfection efficiency with an optimal size of 400â€“500 nm, due to a cellular-uptake-related mechanism.

[Albumin-biomineralized nanoparticles to synergize phototherapy and immunotherapy against melanoma](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0168365920301978)

**Zhu Y\***, Xue J, Chen W, Bai S, Zheng T, He C, Guo Z, Jiang M, Du G, Sun X.

<strong><img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/86%20citations-blue?style=flat" alt="86 citations" /></strong>

- To date, cancer phototherapy remains as an unsatisfactory method of cancer treatment due to the high probability of cancer recurrence - an effect that is partly driven by tumor-driven immunosuppression. Therefore, we propose inducing adequate immune responses after photo tumor ablation may be critical to achieve a long term therapeutic effect of phototherapy. Here, we engineered the photosensitizer chlorin e6 (Ce6) and the time-honored immunoadjuvant aluminum hydroxide into bovine serum albumin by albumin-based biomineralization as a novel nanosystem (Al-BSA-Ce6 NPs) for photoimmune therapy.
