### Engineering the future of medicine  
**through gene therapy, biomaterials, and spatial immunoengineering**

</div>

---

I am a biomedical engineer developing **gene therapy and mRNA-based therapeutic platforms** to interrogate and reprogram immune and tissue responses in vivo.  
My research integrates **lipid nanoparticle (LNP) engineering**, **spatial proteomics**, and **systems immunology** to understand how tissue context, aging, and biomaterial design jointly shape therapeutic efficacy.

I am currently a **Postdoctoral Researcher in Biomedical Engineering at Duke University**, working with Dr. John W. Hickey, following doctoral and postdoctoral training at Johns Hopkins University.
